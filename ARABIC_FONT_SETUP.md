# Arabic Font Setup for PDF Printing

## Current Status
✅ **Arabic support fully implemented and fixed** - The PDF now uses Times New Roman font which has excellent Arabic character support, all text uses the `.tr` extension for proper localization, and all font references have been properly restored.

## How to Add Custom Arabic Font (Optional Enhancement)

### 1. Download Arabic Font
- Download a TTF font file that supports Arabic characters
- Recommended fonts: Noto Sans Arabic, Cairo, or Amiri
- Place the `.ttf` file in `assets/fonts/` directory

### 2. Update pubspec.yaml
```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: ArabicFont
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/your_arabic_font.ttf
```

### 3. Update the _loadArabicFont Method
In `lib/features/sales_management/presentation/pages/invoice_detail_screen.dart`:

```dart
Future<pw.Font?> _loadArabicFont() async {
  try {
    final fontData = await rootBundle.load('assets/fonts/your_arabic_font.ttf');
    return pw.Font.ttf(fontData);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Arabic font not found, using default font: $e');
    return null; // Will fallback to Helvetica
  }
}
```

### 4. Run flutter pub get
```bash
flutter pub get
```
